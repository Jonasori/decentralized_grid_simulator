    A representation of a node in an energy grid.
    
    There are two (?) forms of energy transfer cost:
        - Dollars: it costs money to take someone else's energy
        - Resistance: There is some energy loss in a transfer
        - Maybe: time delay?
        
    Can control a node's desire for energy by changing dollar cost
        - If our excess is close to storage_capacity, then our buying
            price should be low.
            
    Should excess and demand be the same variable, just negative?
    
    Likewise, what is the relationship between energy stored and energy generated?
    I think they can be treated the same; both are just excesses.
    
    Todos:
    - Update the cost functions
    - Figure out units
    - Longterm: Demand forecasting (with weather?)
        - Reflected in cost fun, i.e. desire to retain or get rid of excesses
