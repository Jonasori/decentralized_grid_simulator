# DER Simulator Journal

Since this is a personal fun project, its development pattern will be a little atypical. I will be deliberately coding blind (no lit review) for some portions, slowly for some portions, and probably inefficiently for a lot of it.

## Version 0: First Sketch (Mid-Late January 2021)
I wanted to start off by putting in place a purely intuitive, first-principles implementation of what a microgrid could look like  from a software perspective. Some benefits of this are:
- Forces me to discover challenges with microgrids before reading about them
- Allows me to build up, keeping my thinking simple
- Avoid the I-don't-need-to-do-this trap. Often I've gone to build some sort of computer vision side project, but once I start reviewing the literature, get discouraged because whatever project I do could just be done by copying someone else's excellent work. By forcing myself to implement at least something on my own, I will approach existing work through my own lens.
